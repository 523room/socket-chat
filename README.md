# socket-chat
This app lets you chat.

https://jv-socket-chat.herokuapp.com/


Its an all chat server
-mentions do not work
-emojis supported only on apple devices......because we made them there (common emojis might work)

Readme was not there when the app was made....because we were satrting out......then for Microsoft Student Club at SRM i had to add this
